The .pkl files are Python binaries created by pickle which is a Python module.

These .pkl files are for the experiments on FFmpeg project. 

The experiments are based on the scenario where there are some labeled historical projects available:

1. The except_ffmpeg_list.pkl contains the vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from the historical projects. The except_ffmpeg_list_id.pkl are the funtion IDs which can be used for generating labels (all the vulnerable functions are named with their CVE IDs).

2. The ffmpeg_list.pkl contains the functions from target project (FFmpeg).
